        <p class="expert">
          Prior to becoming a Full-stack Web developer, I was a photographer. I like to think there isn't just one way to do a task, but rather many individual ways to do them.  I like to look at code as the building blocks for creativity and innovation. I took my skills of being a photographer and used it to design websites.
